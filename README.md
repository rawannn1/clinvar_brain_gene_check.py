# Brain Gene ClinVar Checker:

This script uses Biopython to check if a gene is in the ClinVar database.

## What it does:
- You type in a brain-related gene (like MECP2 or SCN2A)
- It searches ClinVar using NCBI's database
- If it finds anything, it tells you "Yes, this gene has clinical variants"
- If not, it says "No records found"

## What you need:
- Python installed
- Biopython installed (`pip install biopython`)
- Internet connection

##  How to run:
1. Save the file as `clinvar_brain_gene_check.py`
2. Open terminal or command prompt
